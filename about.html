                    I am a Forest Data Scientist with a background in Forest Engineering, working at the intersection
                    of data science, machine learning, and statistics applied to the forestry sector. I hold a
                    Master’s degree in Forest Engineering from UFSM, with a focus on forest growth and yield,
                    geotechnologies, and the application of machine learning techniques for qualitative and
                    quantitative forest monitoring. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science
                    at IFFar, deepening my knowledge in programming and computational solution development.

                    Throughout my career, I have developed the Python library ForestPyTools and the QGIS plugin
                    FPT PlotAllocation, aimed at optimizing planning and data processing in forest management
                    projects. I have experience in geoprocessing, remote sensing, forest inventory, statistical
                    modeling, and in developing machine learning and deep learning models for estimating forest
                    attributes.
