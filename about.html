                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    I hold a degree in Forest Engineering and I am currently completing my Master's
                    degree at the Federal University of Santa Maria, while also pursuing a degree in Computer
                    Science at the
                    Farroupilha Federal Institute.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    As part of my Masterâ€™s research, I developed a Python library and a QGIS plugin aimed at
                    optimizing data
                    analysis in forest management projects. I currently work as a self-employed data analyst,
                    providing customized
                    data analysis services for clients. In addition, I collaborate with companies on research
                    projects focused on
                    applying computer vision algorithms for qualitative monitoring of forest plantations.

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    To strengthen my skills in data science, programming, and geoprocessing, I have actively
                    participated in the
                    Geoprocessing and Remote Sensing Laboratory, as well as the Forest Management and Statistics
                    Laboratory. I
                    also enhanced my expertise during my time at Brasplan and CMPC Celulose Riograndense, where I
                    gained
                    experience in data analysis, geoprocessing, development of interactive dashboards and web apps,
                    and was
                    responsible for building artificial neural networks to model height-diameter relationships in
                    forest stands.

                    I am a curious and passionate learner, always seeking new technologies and driven by continuous
                    improvement.
                    My current focus is on deepening my knowledge in data science, machine learning, AI algorithms,
                    and statistics.
